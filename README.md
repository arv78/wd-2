A validation form implemented by HTML/CSS/JavaScript

- first commit
++ first implemented the html part in a table format to have a clean and neat form
++ and then used the css font-face to define my fonts which are BNazanin and BTitr and used them in elements of the table
++ furthermore, for JS I implemented the validation form gradually in further commits and the restrictions that they need to follow and observe

- next commits
-- deleted the table formate because of reponsiveness of the page and utilized and made use of grid 
++ made use of media in CSS in three different scenarios with distinct sizes of the viewport(screen)
++ added some functions to my JS file to check the persion/English/number patterns

-> index.html
-> main.css
-> main.js
